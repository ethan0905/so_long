## üß± Subject
You must create a small 2D game where a dolphin
escapes earth after eating some fish. Or any hero
collects any valuables before leaving the place.
You will use 2d view (top-down or profile)

## üéÆ Features
I implemented basic game mechanics that you can find on traditionnal games.  
* Press key to start an event  
* Open a dialog-box  
* Animated sprites
* Inventory
* Life bar
* Intro story

## üìú Story Mode
I added a story extension if you use a specific map size. You can discover it by playing on `map/piano.ber` :

## üßë‚Äçüíª 2.5D semi isometric view
In this project, I decided to use a 2.5d isometric view.  
In order to create the isometric effect, here are the steps :
* Step 1: I parse my map to get all my elements into a 2 dimensional array of char (char **)  
````shell
1111111111
1000000001
1000000001
1000000001
1000000001
1111111111
````
* Step 2: From last line, I moving up in my array, and for each line I am moving up, I am gonna add one more X at the begining of my line. This has for effect to create my 45 angle view. I finish by completing each of my line with X's in order to get a squared map that will perfectly fit inside my window.
````shell
XXXXX1111111111
XXXX1000000001X
XXX1000000001XX
XX1000000001XXX
X1000000001XXXX
1111111111XXXXX
````
* Step 3: I use this new 2d_map to print my textures at the right place.

## ‚úèÔ∏è How do I print my textures ?
.xpm format does not support transparency. If you are doing a 2d top-view(for example), you can counter this problem by pasting your texture on top of your floor texture. But because of the perspective, I couldn't use this method, so I recode the mlx_put_image_to_window from the minilibx, mlx_pixel_put(), to make it more efficient and faster, to have a really smooth result.
````c
void	my_mlx_pixel_put(t_test *test, int x, int y, int color)
{
	char	*dest;
	dest = test->data.addr + (y * test->data.line_length + x * (test->data.bits_per_pixel / 8));
	*(unsigned int *)dest = color;
}
````
Then I simply told my algorithm that if it encounters a specific dark pixel (0xFF000000), It does not need to print it.  

## üì¶ Object Generation

I managed to generate differents furnitures, depending on how the walls are placed inside the map playable zone.

I also managed to display differents collectibles with pseudo-randomizer algorithm. (Because randomness does'nt really exist)
