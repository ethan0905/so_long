## Subject
You must create a small 2D game where a dolphin
escapes earth after eating some fish. Or any hero
collects any valuables before leaving the place.
You will use 2d view (top-down or profile)

## Goal

## Map parsing
In order to create the isometric effect, I implemented this trick to create a 45 angle:
```
XXXXX1111111111
XXXX1000000001X
XXX1000000001XX
XX1000000001XXX
X1000000001XXXX
1111111111XXXXX
```
